        "*   **File format:** You should also be mindful of the file format you choose. Some OCR engines will only accept certain file formats, so it is best to check this in advance; some will only use image files, whereas others will work on PDF files. Common image file types are TIFF, JPEG and PNG. TIFF files are lossless files, meaning that no image quality or information is lost; this means that TIFF images are usually high quality but also much larger file sizes. PNGs are also lossless, although TIFF files would be preferred over PNGs for OCR. JPEGs are a lossy format type, meaning that the image is compressed to create a smaller file size. OCR engines can work with JPEGs, but there may be a loss of image quality that can impact the text generation.  \n",
        "*   **Image colour:** The colour of your images can impact text quality too; colour images can be used, but ensure there is a sharp contrast between the background page and the text itself (for example black text on white or cream paper). Some OCR engines convert the inputted images to grayscale or a bi-tonal (meaning black and white) format to enable the engine to pick up the text more easily.\n",
        "*   **Text orientation:** The orientation of your text is also important in text recognition as the letters that your OCR engine tries to match against will be the ‘right’ way up and straight on the page, so making sure that the text in the documents you upload is ‘straight on’ in the document or image will produce the best results. Text on an angle, for example diagonally or on its side will be harder for the OCR engine to recognise correctly as the letters will be more difficult to identify.\n",

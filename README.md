# Image to Tech: Introduction to Text Extraction

Welcome to the Readme file for the CDCS Workshop 'Image to Tech: Introduction to Text Extraction'. Below you can find all the details that you will need to get ready and attend this class.

## Overview
Do you need to analyse text in your research, but only have images or scanned PDFs to work with? This training session is the perfect introduction to extracting text from images into a machine-readable data format. This workshop will give you an overview of text extraction and how Optical Character Recognition (OCR) works in practice, how you can plan your projects, and what potential challenges you might face. Weâ€™ll use free, out-of-the box options that are widely available, and you will leave the workshop prepared to use text extraction in your own projects. This resource is designed to introduce you to the basics of text extraction and will include:

- An introduction to text extraction
- The history of text extraction
- How text extraction works in practice, from document selection to cleaning
- How to approach text extraction processes

### What do I need to know?
This is a beginer-level workshop and does not require any prior programming knowledge or background of text extraction processes.

## What do you need for this class?
- A laptop
- A Wi-Fi connection

### Materials
This repository contains a GoogleColab file that can be used in independent study to learn more about text extraction but will also be used in the workshop to show some basic code in action.
